**FOLLOW UP ACTIONS:

1. Build a simple Database
--> Platform: SUPABASE
Establish and understand SUPABASE Connection to NUXT using sample data first [DONE]

1.1. Using SQL_AUTH_LIST on SUPABASE, use it to counter-check for correct credentials before pushing user to homepage (home.vue)  [DONE]
1.2. Build another table on SUPABASE that displays USER-SPECIFIC INFO, i.e. TO-DO LIST ONLY FOR THAT USER
1.3. Features for user to modify todo list, should be done before on VUE just bring over
